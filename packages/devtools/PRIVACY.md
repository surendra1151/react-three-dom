# Privacy Policy — React Three DOM DevTools

**Last updated:** February 2025

## Summary

React Three DOM DevTools does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal or usage data.

## What this extension does

- It adds an **R3F** tab to Chrome DevTools.
- It communicates only with the **page you are inspecting** (the tab where you opened DevTools) via Chrome’s DevTools API (`chrome.devtools.inspectedWindow.eval`) to read the scene graph from `window.__R3F_DOM__` (provided by the page’s own code when using `@react-three-dom/core`).
- All processing happens locally in your browser. No data is sent to any external server.

## Data collection

- **None.** No analytics, no telemetry, no account data, no cookies, and no data is transmitted off your device.
